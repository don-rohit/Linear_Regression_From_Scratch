# Linear_Regression_From_Scratch

As a conclusion of Linear Regression model.
I tried to implement
### 1. Linear regression with One Variable Using Ordinary Least Square Method
### 2. Linear regression with One Variable Using Gradient Descent
### 3. Linear regression with One Variable Using sklearn.linear_model
### 4. Linear regression with Mutiple Variable Using Gradient Descent and by Doing Derivative
### 5. Linear regression with Mutiple Variable Using Gradient Descent and by Using Matrix Implementation
### 6. Linear regression with Mutiple Variable Using sklearn.linear_model


_Linear Regression One Variable_

# Dataset Used
*Headbrain.csv* this dataset contains head size and brain weight of 237 different people. This data set has other features. But, we will not use them in this model.

Linear Regression using Gradient Descent
###### Accuracy :  0.5657205360649368
Linear Regression using Ordinary Least Square Method
###### Accuracy :  0.6393117199570004
Linear Regression using sklearn.linear_model
###### Accuracy :  0.6393117199570001

Ordinary Least Square Method and sklearn.linear_model gives almost same accuracy but Gradient Descent gives bit less accuracy



_Linear Regression Mutiple Variable_

# Dataset Used
*student.csv* In this particular dataset, we have math, reading and writing exam scores of 1000 students. We will try to find a predict the score of writing exam from math and reading scores.

Linear Regression using Gradient Descent and by Doing Derivative
###### Accuracy :  0.5657205360649368
Linear Regression using Gradient Descent and by Using Matrix Implementation
###### Accuracy :  0.6393117199570004
Linear Regression using sklearn.linear_model
###### Accuracy :  0.6393117199570001

Ordinary Least Square Method and sklearn.linear_model gives almost same accuracy but Gradient Descent gives bit less accuracy
